# From Features to Forecasts: Predicting Home Prices Using Computational Statistics

This is a group project that was done as part of the "Computational Statistics" course.

## Objectives

The objective of this project is to get a hand-on experience in a team of data scientists, applying what was learned in the class to a real-world data set.  The data set is **housing** , which has a rich set of features and can be downloaded here.  

**Data set** : https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data

The key tasks are to process the data, build  statistical models predict the house prices and write an evaluation analysis on the goodness of the models.  


## Repository Content

### Report (report.md)

This file is a stand-alone document that explains how we (pre)processed the data, how we built the models and selected the relevant features, and how we analyzed the model outputs.  

### Code notebook

This notebook contains all the code we wrote from loading the data, preprocessing, collecting statistics, building the models, and analysis.
